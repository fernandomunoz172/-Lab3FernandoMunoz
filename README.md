4. In Program.cs write a comment that says While loop
5. Using a while loop create  a loop that asks the user for a number between 10 and 99.
6. If the number given is evenly divisible by 23  show the user a green screen.
7. If the number is not evenly divisible by 23  show a red screen
8. If the user types exit end the  and display the text thank you for playing.
9. In Program.cs write a comment that says Do While loop
10. Using a do while loop create a loop that asks the user for a number between 10 and 99.
11. If the number given is evenly divisible by 34  show the user a green screen.
12. If the number is not evenly divisible by 34  show a red screen
13. If the user types exit end the  and display the text thank you for playing.
14. In Program.cs write a comment that says For loop
Using a for loop create a loop that asks the user for a number between 10 and 99.
If the number given is evenly divisible by 33 show the user a green screen.
If the number is not evenly divisible by 33 show a red screen

Create a menu using a switch statement.( I suggest using a while loop)
The options for the switch statement are add, subtract, multiply, divide and exit.
Depending on the selected option ask the user for two numbers and perform the operation requested. (If they ask to add add the two numbers together and display the result.)
Push your program to the remote Repo.
Submit the URL to the remote Repo you created.
